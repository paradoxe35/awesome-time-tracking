# Zeit

Zeit is an open-source command-line tool for tracking time spent on tasks and projects. It provides a straightforward interface for managing and recording time usage directly from the terminal, making it suitable for programmers and users who prefer CLI tools.

## Features
- **Track Time**: Start, stop, and manage time tracking for activities, associating each entry with a project and task.
- **Flexible Data Structure**: Projects and tasks can be created on-the-fly or managed explicitly using dedicated commands.
- **Custom Project Colors**: Assign hex color codes to projects for improved stats display (if terminal supports colors).
- **Automatic Git Integration**: Optionally import Git commit messages as activity notes during time tracking (requires git in PATH).
- **Activity Management**: List, display, update, and erase tracked activities using various filters (date, project, etc.).
- **Statistics**: View summaries and statistics of tracked time (details depend on terminal capabilities).
- **Data Import**: Import tracked activities from Tyme 3 JSON exports, with SHA1-based duplicate prevention.
- **Data Export**: Export activities in zeit's internal JSON format or Tyme 3 JSON for compatibility.
- **Relational Views**: List projects and tasks in relational views, optionally filtered by date.
- **Multiple Platforms Supported**: Available for macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Plan9.
- **Configurable Database Location**: Store the activity database at any filesystem location via environment variable.
- **Integrations and Extensions**: Supports community and personal extensions for enhanced workflows.

## Pricing
