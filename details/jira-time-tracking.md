# Jira Time Tracking

[Jira Time Tracking](https://toggl.com/blog/jira-time-tracking) is a native feature within Jira, a widely used project management and issue tracking platform. It enables teams and individuals to track time spent on tasks, manage worklogs, and generate reports for time management and productivity analysis. While Jira provides basic time tracking capabilities, many users choose to enhance its functionality with dedicated time tracking plugins.

## Features

- **Enable/Disable Time Tracking:** Time tracking is turned on by default in Jira Cloud, but can be enabled or disabled for each project and issue type.
- **Time Tracking Fields:** Add the 'Time Tracking' field to various issue types (Epics, Tasks, Sub-Tasks, Bugs) to capture time data.
- **Time Estimates:** Set original time estimates for issues to establish baselines for tracking and to measure estimation accuracy.
- **Manual Time Logging:** Users can manually record the actual time spent on issues as work progresses.
- **Worklogs:** Maintain a log of time entries per issue for audit and reporting purposes.
- **Timesheet Reports:** Managers can generate simple timesheet reports from the Jira dashboard to oversee capacity, velocity, and resource allocation.
- **Integration with Plugins:** Jira supports integration with advanced time tracking plugins (e.g., Toggl Track, Memtime, Everhour, Timely) for automated tracking, detailed reporting, invoicing, and more.

## Limitations

- **Manual Entry:** Native time tracking is primarily manual and may lack automation, leading to potential inaccuracies.
- **Limited Advanced Features:** Lacks advanced reporting, automatic tracking, and invoicing found in dedicated time tracking tools.

## Integration Options

Jira can be integrated with several popular time tracking tools to extend its capabilities:

- **Toggl Track:** Offers automatic time tracking, detailed reporting, and seamless Jira integration via a browser extension.
- **Memtime:** Provides automatic time tracking in the background, syncing tracked time with Jira projects and tasks.
- **Everhour:** Focuses on project-based tracking, budgeting, and invoicing, with a Jira plugin for direct integration.
- **Timely:** Tracks activities automatically and provides business insights, with partial Jira integration for syncing work activities.

## Pricing

- Jira's native time tracking feature is included as part of Jira (pricing depends on your Jira plan).
- Third-party plugins and integrations (e.g., Toggl Track, Memtime, Everhour, Timely) have their own pricing structures (not detailed in the content above).
